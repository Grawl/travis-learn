#!/bin/bash
# This is a Bash shell script to use with [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org)
# It will build your project as you will configure Travis CI, and if there will be any changes, it will push them into your repository as a commit. Basically, this script will push any added or removed files by your build process.
# For example: if you update `some-script.js`, you want to minify it and push as `some-script.min.js`. Travis CI can launch your build script on it's own server just after you push `some-script.js` and then it will push updated `some-script.min.js`.
# To use it, you have to authenticate on Travis CI and enable Continuous Integration for this project, then open settings and add some environment variables to allow Travis CI to push into your repository:
# `GIT_HOST` – server hostname, `github.com` by default
# `GIT_USER` – username
# `GIT_PASSWORD` – password
# Don't worry, [you can trust Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings)
# Also, you have to add `.travis.yml` file with this:

# script:
#  - bash ./build.sh #for example
#  - bash ./deploy.sh

# Configuring Travis CI [is not hard](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/), just few lines and you are a pilot!

# I am using some Travis environment variables like `TRAVIS` or `TRAVIS_COMMIT` here, you can look their output in [Travis CI Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables)
